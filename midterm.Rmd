Below we define any relevant probability constants so they can be easily changed.
``` {r}
OFFSIDE_PROB = 0.15
LONGSHOT_PROB = 0.3
PASS_TO_SECTOR2_PROB = 0.6
GOALIE_SCORE = 7
```

Below we define helper functions that will be used to simulate the game. The `lst_sample` allows us to sample from a list of any size without the unexpected behavior of just using `sample` on lists of size 1. `defense_score` and `offense_score` calculate and return the defense and offense score based on which team has possession.
``` {r}
lst_sample <- function(x, size, replace = F) {
  if (length(x) == 1) return(rep(x, size))
  base::sample(x, size = size, replace = replace)
}

offense_score <- function(team_1,team_2,game_state){
  if (game_state$team_possession==1){
    N <- which(team_1$sector == game_state$ball_in_sector)
    score = 0
    for (i in N){
      score <- score + team_1$offense_score[i]
    }
  } else {
    N <- which(team_2$sector == game_state$ball_in_sector)
    score = 0
    for (i in N){
      score <- score + team_2$offense_score[i]
    }
  }
  return(score)
}

defense_score <- function(team_1,team_2,game_state){
  if (game_state$team_possession==2){
    N <- which(team_1$sector == game_state$ball_in_sector)
    score = 0
    for (i in N){
      score <- score + team_1$defense_score[i]
    }
  } else {
    N <- which(team_2$sector == game_state$ball_in_sector)
    score = 0
    for (i in N){
      score <- score + team_2$defense_score[i]
    }
  }
  return(score)
}
```

Below we define the `minute` function to simulate 1 minute of the game. This is where all of the game logic was written.
``` {r}
minute <- function(team_1, team_2, game_state) {
  game_state$cur_minute = game_state$cur_minute + 1

  #Goalie possession stuff

    #pass to sector 2 with probability 0.6

      game_state$ball_in_sector = 2

Below a monte carlo function is defined that would be used to approximate the true probabilities of each team winning the game.
``` {r}
